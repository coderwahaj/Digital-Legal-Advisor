Earlier, amendments in Companies Ordinance, 1984 were made in piecemeal and were narrowly focused, resulting in disconnect and overlap in regulatory framework and there is a dire need to review and revamp the thirty-two years old legislation to provide competitive legal framework for the corporate sector in Pakistan. The said Bill will ensure maximum participations of members in decision making process of the company through use of modern electronic means of communication and aim to address the issues relating to protection of interest of minority shareholders and creditors. It will facilitate the growth of economy in general and the corporate sector in particular by providing simplified procedure for ease of starting and doing business, greater protection investors and augment corporatization in the country. The Bill provides adequate manners against fraud, money laundering and terrorist finances and necessary provisions have been proposed regarding powers of the commission including joint investigation and provision requiring officers of a company to take adequate measures to curb such violations. In order to give immediate impetus to the economy and to stimulate economic growth there is an emergent need to promulgate the proposed Companies Bill, 2017 to provide relief and incentives to corporate sectors especially small medium size companies.",

The encouragement of use of modern communication technology coupled with simplified regulatory procedure as envisaged in the new company law will provide much needed relief to corporate sector. Moreover, Pakistan has recently been upgraded to emerging market status and there is huge international interest to invest in Pakistan due various policy initiatives of the government. The expeditious merger and acquisition mechanism is also necessary to address corporate solvency and growth in Pakistan.
